Wii.py3 (WIP)
=======
This is a work-in-progress rewrite of the Wii library [Wii.py](https://github.com/grp/Wii.py) in Python 3(.7).
The end goal is to improve the original code, make a few changes to ensure correct behaviour and add new classes and functions for manipulating more Wii data.

This is a rewrite of my [original Wii.py3](https://github.com/Brawl345/Wii.py3) since the code was horrible.

## Credits
* [grp](https://github.com/grp) for the original library
* All authors who contributored to the original Wii.py

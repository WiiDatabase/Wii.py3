This is a work-in-progress rewrite of the Wii library [Wii.py](https://github.com/grp/Wii.py) in Python >= 3.4.
The end goal is to improve the original code, make a few changes to ensure correct behaviour and add new classes and functions for manipulating more Wii data.

This is a rewrite of my [original Wii.py3](https://github.com/Brawl345/Wii.py3) since the code was horrible.

PyPy 3.5 is NOT supported, because its CTypes implementation is [too buggy](https://travis-ci.com/WiiDatabase/Wii.py3/jobs/196491584#L256-L271).
